# LinuxMacroKeyboard

A small program I wanted for myself that others may find useful. Allows using a second keyboard or keypad for macros.

On first run, it generates an example keymap to show how the specification works.

I left enough infrastructure in place to later support other inputs besides keyboard button presses as macro output, but it doesn't support that as of yet.
